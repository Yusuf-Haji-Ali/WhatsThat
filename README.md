# WhatsThat?

WhatsThat? is a totally unique, non-plagiarised messaging platform which allows users to communicate with each other. Users sign up for an account with WhatsThat? and can then search for and add contacts and create chats with individuals or groups of contacts. 

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository into a directory on your local machine. If you have Git installed on your machine then you can run git clone https://github.com/yusuf-haji-ali/whatsthatapp in your terminal
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run the app with `npx expo start`

## Running the Server

1. Navigate to the assets/WhatsThatApp directory.
2. Run the server with `npm run dev`.
3. Test everything is working using Postman. The API documentation can be found by navigating to http://localhost:3333/api/1.0.0/documentation in your browser.

## Components

Components are split into their respective uses throughout the app.

E.g: components mainly used by Chats/ChatScreen will be found in the Chats folder. All components that a used globally around the app are found in the reusable folder.

## Wireframes

I have drawn up a plan of how I wanted the app to look before development. This includes a High Fidelity Wireframe which was made using Figma and it's respective heirarchy of navigation.
Both can be found in the Assets folder -> Wireframes.
