# WhatsThat?

WhatsThat? is a totally unique, non-plagiarised messaging platform which allows users to communicate with each other. Users sign up for an account with WhatsThat? and can then search for and add contacts and create chats with individuals or groups of contacts. 

## Getting Started 


### Run the Server

1. Navigate to the assets/WhatsThatServer directory.
3. Open the directory in the terminal and run the server with `npm run dev`.
3. Test everything is working using Postman. The API documentation can be found by navigating to http://localhost:3333/api/1.0.0/documentation in your browser once the server is running.

### Run the App

1. Navigate back to the root directory and in the terminal run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run the app with `npx expo start`

## Wireframes

I have drawn up a plan of how I wanted the app to look before development. This includes a High Fidelity Wireframe which was made using Figma and its respective heirarchy of navigation. Both can be found in the assets/Wireframes directory.
