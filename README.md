# WhatsThat?

This is the WhatsThat App code for the Mobile Applications Development (6G6Z1104_2223_9Z6) Assignment.

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository into a directory on your local machine. If you have Git installed on your machine then you can run git clone https://github.com/yusuf-haji-ali/whatsthatapp in your terminal
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run the app with `npx expo start`

## Components

Components are split into their respective uses throughout the app.

E.g: components mainly used by Chats/ChatScreen will be found in the Chats folder. All components that a used globally around the app are found in the reusable folder.

## Wireframes

I have drawn up a plan of how I wanted the app to look before development. This includes a High Fidelity Wireframe which was made using Figma and it's respective heirarchy of navigation.
~ Both can be found in the Assets folder -> Wireframes.
